            <br />
            <h5 class="heading-group">Increased Muscle Mass and Metabolism</h5>
            <br />
            <p class="popup-text">
              Strength training induces muscle hypertrophy, leading to an
              increase in lean muscle mass. As muscles grow, they become more
              metabolically active, contributing to a higher basal metabolic
              rate (BMR). This metabolic boost supports weight management and
              fat loss over time.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h5 class="heading-group">
              Improved Bone Density and Joint Health
            </h5>
            <br />
            <p class="popup-text">
              Weight-bearing exercises, integral to strength training, enhance
              bone density, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.
              Additionally, strengthening muscles around joints provides better
              support, promoting joint health and preventing injuries.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h5 class="heading-group">
              Enhanced Functional Strength for Daily Activities
            </h5>
            <br />
            <p class="popup-text">
              Strength training focuses on compound movements that mimic
              real-life activities, improving functional strength. This
              translates to enhanced performance in daily tasks, such as
              lifting, carrying, and maintaining proper posture.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h5 class="heading-group">Prevention of Age-Related Muscle Loss</h5>
            <br />
            <p class="popup-text">
              Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass, can be mitigated
              through consistent strength training. By challenging muscles
              regularly, individuals can maintain and even increase muscle mass
              as they age, supporting overall health and independence.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4>1.2 Understanding the Principles</h4>
            <br />
            <h5 class="heading-group">Progressive Overload</h5>
            <br />
            <p class="popup-text">
              Progressive overload involves gradually increasing the resistance
              or intensity of exercises to challenge the muscles continually.
              This principle is foundational for sustained strength gains.
              Methods include adding weight, increasing repetitions, or
              adjusting exercise difficulty.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h5 class="heading-group">Proper Form and Technique</h5>
            <br />
            <p class="popup-text">
              Ensuring correct form during exercises is crucial for
              effectiveness and injury prevention. Proper technique maximizes
              muscle engagement while minimizing stress on joints. Individuals,
              especially beginners, should prioritize learning and maintaining
              proper form.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h5 class="heading-group">Adequate Rest and Recovery</h5>
            <br />
            <p class="popup-text">
              Muscles need time to repair and grow stronger after a workout.
              Adequate rest and recovery include quality sleep, proper
              nutrition, and allowing specific muscle groups to recover before
              targeting them again. Overtraining can lead to fatigue, increased
              injury risk, and diminished results.

            <br />
            <h5 class="heading-group">
              Establishing Short-Term and Long-Term Objectives
            </h5>
            <br />
            <p class="popup-text">
              Effective goal-setting involves defining both short-term and
              long-term objectives. Short-term goals create stepping stones for
              long-term success, providing a sense of accomplishment and
              motivation along the way.

            <br />
            <p class="popup-text">
              Goals should align with an individual's current fitness level,
              considering factors like age, health conditions, and prior
              exercise experience. Tailoring goals ensures they are achievable
              and sustainable.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>2.2 Creating a Balanced Workout Routine</h4>
            <br />
            <h5 class="heading-group">
              Incorporating Compound and Isolation Exercises
            </h5>
            <br />
            <p class="popup-text">
